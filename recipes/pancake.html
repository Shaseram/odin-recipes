        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Make crispy mashed potato pancakes that stay fluffy inside in a snap with leftover mashed potatoes. <br>
            I like to make one large potato pancake and slice it into wedges, <br>
            but you can make individual-sized potato pancakes, which are easier to flip, if you prefer.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups cold mashed potatoes</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons potato starch or cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons thinly sliced fresh chives, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, plus 1 teaspoon olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Mix together mashed potatoes, potato starch, egg, salt, pepper, garlic powder,<br>
                    and 1 teaspoon of the chives in a medium bowl until combined. The mixture <br>
                    should be slightly sticky but not loose.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat <br>
                    until hot and oil is fragrant. Spoon potato mixture into skillet and press it into an <br> 
                    even layer to create a potato pancake about 9 inches in diameter.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Reduce heat to medium; cover skillet with a lid or flat cookie sheet and cook, <br>
                    giving skillet a 90-degree turn every 2 to 3 minutes, until golden brown around <br>
                    the edges and top of pancake feels almost dry to the touch, 8  to 9 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Slide potato pancake onto a large plate. Spray another large plate <br>
                    with nonstick cooking spray and invert the potato pancake onto greased plate.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Add remaining 1 teaspoon oil to skillet and heat over medium. Slide pancake <br>
                    back into skillet and cook, uncovered, until golden brown on the other side, about 5 more minutes.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Slide pancake onto a cutting board and garnish with remaining 1 teaspoon chives.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Slice into 8 wedges and serve immediately. Enjoy!</p>
