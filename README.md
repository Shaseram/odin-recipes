# odin-recipes
First project from the Foundations Course from Odin
Implements: Basic HTML with links and images.

I did not use the attribute rel that include "noopener" and "noreferrer" in "img" element, basically because 
i understand that i need to use relative links and that i should simply ignore the attributes
used for absolute links.
